# Please dont change or delete anything without commenting about what you changed/deleted.
This is in no real order, just ideas that were spewed from my mind, additions are welcome. (Would like comments about what was added as  well so I can look at it and get ideas from it myself :D)

Terms I might use that you may or may not know the meaning of:
 * DR - Damage Resistance

### World ideas:
* mario style world (sidescrolling and minimal up/down option, but I would really enjoy trying to build a full 2d world, similar to metroid)
* stage 1 (probably the only one we actualy do unless we get really creative or the final project requires it) a house
* bonus? stage/level/area is a fairy land type place with environment traps of rainbow unicorn poop that shoot rainbow lazers into the sky. 
* In each level/area will be a fairy powerup and at stations (or inventory) the player can switch which fairy is equipped and so get past obstacles or simply to make any combat easier.

### Current ideas for fairy powerups:
  * Light gravity fairy   - reduces gravity by some amount, makes the player not trigger any pressure plates? this fairy and small fairy could be the same things from different angles or they could be different enough
  * Small fairy - makes the player smaller, which lets them into other areas, lets them jump... higher or not as high? reduces their hitbox for attacks as well as getting attacked.
  * Heavy gravity fairy   - adds to melee damage, and also lets the cat trigger some pressure plates, but does make jumping harder, maybe also deal extra falling damage? this fairy and large fairy could be the same things from different angles or they could be different enough
  * Large fairy - makes the player larger, making it so they cant get into some areas, but also increases their hitbox for attacks and getting attacked. prolly raise their damage, either makes them jump higher or not as high.
  * Fire fairy - attacks by the main character light enemies on fire and deals damage over time, maybe change to poison fairy? OR/and? when the fairy button is pushed deal 'fire' damage to everything on screen and ignite them? (possibly including the player)
  * Ice/cold fairy - attacks lower the enemy damage and after X attacks will freeze the enemy. OR/and? when the fairy is used will freeze everything on screen that isnt resistant to cold for a time. possibly including the player if they dont have some type of cold resist?
  * Shield/guardian fairy - creates a barrier around the player that either reduces damage taken, or cancles a single attack every... 5? seconds, or every time the fairy button is pressed but will need to take a decent chunk of energy... or smallish amount of health? would let us make world achievments like unharmable where the player wouldnt be able to shield spam their way through it
  * Bomb fairy - explode an enemy every 30? seconds. deals damage to the enemy targeted as well as dealing damage to every enemy within melee? range.
  * Key fairy - will let you past locked doors and into locked things that are not a digital keypad? would mainly be a treasure hunting/story fairy
  * Combat fairy - will shoot a beam? projectile? at the nearest enemy every 5? seconds. the attack will/will not go through to damage enemies on the other side (maybe make that the double effect?), and will do... 5? damage to enemie(s) that are hit. Could also make the fairy fly to that point and melee for a bit instead of shooting. can also make it only shoot when the fairy button is pressed
  
                          
Could make the fairys require energy for their effect to work? (a toggle key to turn on or off a fairy?)
  
Maybe make an orb or beam or station or even just a button that takes... ~90% or more energy that 'doubles' the effect of the fairy for a limited time?
  
### Player ideas:
 * The player will be a cat who (similarly to mario) is not explained, but is going from one side of each world to the other
 * HP set at 100 so that its easy to do % based damage. maybe let there be damage reduction powerups, but no hp powerups.
 * Energy set at 100 for the same reason that HP is.
 * does energy regenerate? and is it slow or semi fast?
 * does HP regenerate? (im leaning twards yes, but really slow, but thats also dependant on if the player gets to level)
 * are there hp/energy globs that get dropped or checkpoints or... 
 * melee attacks for sure while the sprite is a cat
 * ranged attacks are more problematic but it would be nice to have the option even if they are energy intensive.
 * could change the player sprites colors to indicate different elemental affinities? to do more/less damage depending on the enemy
 * does the player get xp from killing things or completing tasks? (I like this idea because I love leveling in games, but also dislike this idea because it could detract from the get items to get more powerful)
    
### Ideas for enemies:
 * all attacks effect everything they should logically effect - I get tired of watching enemy attacks not deal damage to other enemies when they connect. not walking into eachother (normally), but things like bullets or energy beams or whatnot. 
 * hp also set at 100 for most enemies? (my biggest reservation about this one is that then there would need to be DR for each monster and the player would need some way to bypass the DR, maybe another fairy? Think I prefer the enemies to have variable HP based on enemy and/or difficulty)
 * maybe make projectile attacks have hp and be able to be shot/meleed down? (also include player projectiles?)
  
 #### Assuming a cat player sprite:
   * birds of various colors/sizes who will swoop down
   * mice and other small critters weilding weapons
   
#### Works with almost any player sprite:
   * LepRecons - a leprechaun in tactical gear? carrying a gun. maybe make them the 'snipers' that so many games have in them? (aka, somthing off in the distance sending a red beam your way and if you trigger it then somthing is shot at you)
