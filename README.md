# Please dont change or delete anything without commenting about what you changed/deleted.
This is in no real order, just ideas that were spewed from my mind, additions are welcome. (Would like comments about what was added as 
  well so I can look at it and get ideas from it myself :D)

Terms I might use that you may or may not know the meaning of:
  DR - Damage Resistance

The game is a mario style world (sidescrolling and minimal up/down option, but I would really enjoy trying to build a full 2d world, 
  similar to metroid)

The player will be a cat who (similarly to mario) is not explained, but is going from one side of each world to the other

In each level/area will be a fairy powerup and at stations (or inventory) the player can switch which fairy is equipped and so get past 
  obstacles or simply to make any combat easier.

Current ideas for fairy powerups:
  Light gravity fairy   - reduces gravity by some amount, makes the not trigger any pressure plates?
  heavy gravity fairy   - adds to melee damage, and also lets the cat trigger some pressure plates, but does make jumping harder, maybe 
                          also deal extra falling damage?
  fire fairy            - attacks by the main character light enemies on fire and deals damage over time, maybe change to poison fairy?
  ice/cold fairy        - attacks lower the enemy damage and after X attacks will freeze the enemy
  shield/guardian fairy - creates a barrier around the player that either reduces damage taken, or cancles a single attack every... 5?  
                          seconds
  bomb fairy            - explode an enemy every 30? seconds. deals damage to the enemy targeted as well as dealing damage to every 
                          enemy within melee? range.
  
                          
  could make the fairys require energy for their effect to work? (a toggle key to turn on or off a fairy?)
  
Player ideas:
  HP set at 100 so that its easy to do % based damage. maybe let there be damage reduction powerups, but no hp powerups.
  Energy set at 100 for the same reason that HP is.
  does energy regenerate? and is it slow or semi fast?
  does HP regenerate?
  are there hp/energy globs that get dropped or checkpoints or... 
  melee attacks for sure while the sprite is a cat
  ranged attacks are more problematic but it would be nice to have the option even if they are energy intensive.
  could change the player sprites colors to indicate different elemental affinities? to do more/less damage depending on the enemy
    
Ideas for enemies:
  all attacks effect everything - I get tired of watching enemy attacks not deal damage to other enemies when they connect. not walking 
  into eachother (normally), but things like bullets or energy beams or whatnot. 
  hp also set at 100 for most enemies? (my biggest reservation about this one is that then there would need to be DR for each monster 
    and the player would need some way to bypass the DR, maybe another fairy?)
  maybe make projectile attacks have hp and be able to be shot/meleed down? (also include player projectiles?)
